Solidity Smart Contract 

This Solidity program is a  basic contract in which we learn that we can't burn more than we have, that demonstrates the all the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language like mapping,
creating public variables,functions,conditional statements . The purpose of this program is to take a hands-on over the latest learnings.

Description
This Solidity contract is designed to serve as an educational example for understanding how to create a simple token-based smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes two functions, "burn" and "mint",
which allow you to keep track of the total supply of tokens, burn a specified amount, and mint (create) new tokens. Additionally, it enforces the rule that you cannot burn more tokens than you currently have in 
supply. This code provides a foundational understanding of Solidity programming and can be used as a starting point for more advanced smart contract projects in the future.
